%% MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION FOR THE PLANNING OF A SINGLE BUILDING REC
% This script allows to optimize the synthesis, design and operation stages
% through a multi-carrier and multi-component Energy Hub model.
% The model allows managing six final demands (electricity, 
% high-temperature and low-temperature heating, cooling, water, and 
% hydrogen).
% The building is linked to six main grids (electricity, district heating, 
% district cooling, water, natural gas, and hydrogen).
% The model can be used for the simplified modeling of a generic energy 
% system (building, cluster of buildings, microgrids, etc.) and perfectly
% fits for the planning problem of a single-building with many apartments 
% making up a Renewable Energy Community (REC).
% The building can provide ancillary services to all the grids exploiting
% the flexibility of the demands.
% The final solution is considered robust since it is based on the 
% uncertainty related to the availability of renewable energy sources and
% to the final demands.
% The optimization is performed over a standard year according to five 
% objective functions (economic, primary energy, carbon emissions,
% grid interactions, critical raw materials) and is based on a 
% mixed-integer linear programming mathematical model.
